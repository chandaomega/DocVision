DETECTING DIABETIC RETINOPATHY THROUGH RETINAL IMAGES
One of the most important involvements of AI in our life has been in the field of healthcare. 
It has been applied to address various problems of the field ranging from diagnosis processes, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient care. 
Departments such Oncology, Dermatology, Cardiology are actively incorporating these leading technologies as a part of their treatment process. 

In our world of 7.8 Billion of population, there has always been a poor doctor to patient ratio. 
That means there has always been a scarcity of doctors, which if alleviated, could lead to saving a lot of lives. 
Now, we cannot magically make doctors, but we can  incorporate machines with some knowledge of the human bodies, 
which although will not be able to work as a doctor in itself but could be a handy tool for self- diagnosis or even an accessory to the doctors.
We could start by dealing with disease that almost 415 Million people in the world are living with, Diabetes. 
It is said to be the ‘silent killer’, because it may go undetected in its initial phase. 47% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed. 
It slowly causes an adverse effect on eyes, liver and heart, in addition, to being a leading cause of complications during surgeries. 
As this disease progresses uncontrollably, it could lead to various complications such as Neuropathy, Nephropathy, Diabetic retinopathy. 
Most of these complications require very expensive and evasive exams for their detection, done under the supervision of a highly qualified doctor. 
But, what if there is shortage of resources or medical staff to carry out the procedures? This is where our tool could come in handy. 
In this work, we have built a software with underlying principles of Machine Learning that will be able to detect Diabetic retinopathy, 
a rare complication that arise in patients due to poorly controlled Blood Sugar, and may eventually lead to blindness.
